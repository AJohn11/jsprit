jsprit
======
jsprit is a java-based, open-source toolkit for solving a set of well-known [vehicle routing problems](http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vehicle-routing-problem/) (VRP). 
It is lightweight and easy-to-use, and based on heuristics currently solving the following problems:
- [Capacitated VRP](http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vrp-flavors/capacitated-vrp/)
- [Multiple Depot VRP](http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vrp-flavors/multiple-depot-vrp/)
- [VRP with time windows](http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vrp-flavors/vrp-with-time-windows/)
- VRP with heterogeneous fleet
- Time-dependent VRP

Modifying the algorithms and visualising the discovered solutions is as easy and handy as 
reading classical VRP instances to benchmark your algorithm.
