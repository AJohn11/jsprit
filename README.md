jsprit
======
jsprit is a java based, open source toolkit for solving a set of well-known <a href="http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vehicle-routing-problem/" target="_blank">vehicle routing problems</a> (VRP). 
It is lightweight and easy-to-use, and based on heuristics currently solving 
- <a href="http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vrp-flavors/capacitated-vrp/" target="_blank">Capacitated VRP</a>
- <a href="http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vrp-flavors/multiple-depot-vrp/" target="_blank">Multiple Depot VRP</a>
- <a href="http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vrp-flavors/vrp-with-time-windows" target="_blank">VRP with time windows</a>
- VRP with heterogeneous fleet
- Time-dependent VRP
- Various combination of these types

Modifying the algorithms and visualising the discovered solutions is as easy and handy as 
reading classical VRP instances to benchmark your algorithm.

##In Development
- VRP with Backhauls
- Pickup and Delivery
- Interface to <a href="http://matsim.org" target="_blank">MATSim</a> which allows network-based problems (e.g. OSM generated), least cost path routing with fast A* and Dijkstra algorithms and dynamic, interactive visualization

##About
The jsprit-project is created and maintained by Stefan Schr√∂der. It is motivated by two issues. 

First, there is an almost endless list of papers and algorithms to tackle vehicle routing problems, **BUT** there are (as far as I know) only a [very few open source implementations](https://github.com/jsprit/jsprit/wiki/Other-Projects) of one of these thousands alogrithms. 

Second, it is motivated by my PhD-project at [KIT](http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) where I apply vehicle routing algorithms to solve behavioural models of freight agents to assess (freight) transport policy measures. 

It is mainly inspired by my research group at [KIT-ECON](http://netze.econ.kit.edu/21.php), and by an awesome open-source project called [MATSim](www.matsim.org) and its developers.
