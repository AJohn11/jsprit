The jsprit-project is created and maintained by [Stefan Schr√∂der](https://github.com/oblonski). It is motivated by two issues. 

First, you can find vehicle routing problems **everywhere** in the world of distributing and moving things and people. This probably explains why there is an almost endless list of papers and algorithms to tackle these problems. However there are only [very few open source implementations](https://github.com/jsprit/jsprit/wiki/Other-Projects) and even fewer projects that can deal with real world problems that usually have many side-constraints.

Second, it is motivated by my PhD-project at [KIT](http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) where I apply vehicle routing algorithms to solve behavioural models of freight agents to assess (freight) transport policy measures. 

It is mainly inspired by my research group at [KIT-ECON](http://netze.econ.kit.edu/21.php), and by a great open-source project called [MATSim](http://www.matsim.org) and its developers.
